# Travel Brochure Project

- This is a project designed by myself and some fellow NSS Cohort 55 members to design a static website that will display information about a country when visited, focus of this project is to get comfortable working with JavaScript databases and dynamically injecting html as oppossed to hard coding it.
- Website designed using only javascript, css, and html. (more on project requirements here: https://github.com/nss-day-cohort-51/automated-world)
- My contributions include styling and scripting dynamically injecting the navbar, brainstorming design templates, sourcing images for the website to use, scripting the dynamic injection of Japan's page, & quality control.


## Instructions for Viewing 
1. Navigate to the directory in which you want MCA to reside
1. run `git clone git@github.com:JavontaeH/automated-world-stephanie-kwolek-s-kevlars.git`
1. run `cd automated-world-stephanie-kwolek-s-kevlars`
1. run `serve` (npm package downloaded here https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) to create a local server to view the website on
1. copy & paste local port from serve command into browser
2. alternatively, use the LiveServer VSCode extension: (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), to serve the code directly from Visual Studio.


## Difficulties:

- Pretty much in the all clear with this one. Still learning new and more advanced techniques that can be done with CSS Flexbox. The scripting and injecting to html comes pretty naturally to me.
