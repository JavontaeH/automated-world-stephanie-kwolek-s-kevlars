        , year: "Old as dirt"
        , description: "Hvitserkur or the Dinosaur Rock in the North is another awe-inspiring sight. Its location, incredible form, and stature is something you can’t help but admire. It is located in the North West, not far from the village of Hvammstangi or Blonduos. The drive there is an additional 40 minutes but well worth it. It is placed out on Vatnsnes peninsula. Away from the typical tourist route."
